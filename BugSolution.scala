```scala
class MyClass(val x: Int) {
  def this() = {
    this(0) // Auxiliary constructor - explicit initialization
  }
}
```
The solution demonstrates an explicit call to the primary constructor within the auxiliary constructor `this(0)`. This ensures that the `x` field is initialized to 0 before any other code in the auxiliary constructor is executed, eliminating the possibility of an unexpected behavior or race condition.
